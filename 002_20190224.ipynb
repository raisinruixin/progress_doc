My attempts to fit sample data into the model were in vain, hence I can't talk much about it for #002, hopefully I can make it for #003. I realised that I wasn't able to demonstrate the dynamics of the model very well last week so I'm making up for it. And then I'll briefly discuss the idea of applying Bayes' rule to models and data."

    "- There are a few assumptions made for this model:\n",
    "    - It is assumed that steady-state conditions hold, i.e. policies coming on-risk are largely replaced by similar policies coming off risk, hence rate parameters are assumed to be constant over development time.\n",
    "    - Earned premiums are considered as exposures and all exposures are input at time 0, which reflects those at risk at the start of the accident year and we observe their development over time.\n",
    "    - These assumptions are made for simplicity for now and can be relaxed later in an advanced stage.\n",
    "    \n",
    "I'll first discuss about the graph on the top:\n",
    "1. The exposures are at their maximum at the beginning of an accident year. As time goes by, when accidents do happen, their state will change to outstanding, else the premium will be considered 'earned' by the company. Take note that there's only a proportion of exposures that will eventually become oustanding (I mean accidents can happen to everyone but will not happen to everyone will they?), hence the need for RLR. If RLR equals 1, then accidents do happen to everyone. Exposures will then gradually decrease to zero at which point the company is no more liable to the insureds.\n",
    "2. So when a proportion of exposed insured do encounter accidents, their state changes to outstanding. You can imagine this stage as waiting for the company to pay out claims, so they are setting aside money in order to fultill their liabilities. Think of it this way, the company is given an amount of money in advanced to pay for unfortunate events happening anytime in the future (policy effective period). There is a risk of accident happening everyday, so at the beginning of time the 'cummulative' risks until the end of time is higher than that during a later time. Say during the last few days of effective period, if nothing happens then the rest of the premium will be earned by the company. So the OS peak at the beginning sort of reflects this idea.\n",
    "3. The amount set aside to pay for claims might be inadequate or in excess, hence the role of RRF in this matter. (I'm not sure if this value can be greater than 1.0, I should ask for professional advice, but in my humble opinion, it can.) As claims get paid, the outstanding claims will get cleared and then return to zero, while cumulatively claims are paid and so PD will gradually increase until a certain point, where no more claims from the insured of the same accident year would come in, and then from there we can tell in the end how much in total the company has paid claims for this particular cohort.\n",
    "4. At any particular point of time, we can calculate the amount of incurred cases (where accidents happened and reported) by summing up OS and PD since they reflect those cases that are reported.\n",

I've had some troubles dealing with zero-division errors and a few other assumptions (which I've yet to find out) while exploring holoviews. Anyway I feel that I should at least do justice to the reasonable amount of time I've spent coming up with these few lines of codes, so I'll just use them here while planning to dump them in near future.
